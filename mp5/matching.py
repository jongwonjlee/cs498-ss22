    Q1. Assigns detections to tracked object

    dets:       a list of Box3D object

    threshold:  only mark a det-trk pair as a match if their iou distance is less than the threshold

        unmatched_dets, a 1d array of indices of unmatched detections
        unmatched_trks, a 1d array of indices of unmatched trackers
