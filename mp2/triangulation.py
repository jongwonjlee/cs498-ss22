Question 5. Triangulation
In this question we move to 3D.
You are given keypoint matching between two images, together with the camera intrinsic and extrinsic matrix.
Your task is to perform triangulation to restore the 3D coordinates of the key points.
In your PDF, please visualize the 3d points and camera poses in 3D from three different viewing perspectives.
